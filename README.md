## Unity-Game-
Recreation of super Mario bros game in unity! 

### This game was part of a school project I had in my video game design class
-IMPORTANT NOTE: I couldnt upload the Library folder of the game since it is a big document (even though I compressed it).

- NOTE: I dont own any of the art work, you can find the art work at the Unity asset story for free. -
- This project mainly shows my skills as a game developer (but not as an art creator).


### Characteristics of the game
- This game includes a main menu section.
- As well as "You win! Game over!" scene.
- All of the characters in the game are fully animated.
- I also design each of the levels.
- The eagles (enemies) are AI scripted/ program. In which they are program to follow the main character, they will continue follow the fox unless the fox decides to kill them.
- The main character will have to find the gem in order to move on to the next level and so on.
- All scripts were made in Unity C#.

### What the game is about?
- I mainly wanted to create this game as a reacreation of super mario bros, where the main character (Mario) goes through a series of levels, faces enemies, and collects coins / different items.
- In my game you can see the main character is a fox. In order to finish each level, the fox needs to find the gem/ diamond, that will give it the pass to the next level. 
- This game has 3 different levels, each one of them is harder than the previous one. 
- Also, for each level, the main character will have to fight with enemies, in this case I created eagles as the main enemy.
- In order to get rid of them, the main character will have to throw some bullets, it takes 2 bullets to get rid of one eagle.
